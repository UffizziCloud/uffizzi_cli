uffizzi-preview-create - create a preview
================================================================

## SYNOPSIS
    uffizzi preview create [COMPOSE_FILE] [UFFIZZI_WIDE_FLAG ...] 

## DESCRIPTION
    Creates a new preview. If no COMPOSE_FILE is specified, the preview 
    is created with the project's default compose file.

    This command can fail for the following reasons: 
        - The project does not have a default compose file set. Run 
          $ uffizzi compose --help for details.  
        - The alternate compose file is invalid.

## POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
    [COMPOSE_FILE]
        An alternate compose file to the default compose.

        You can pass a compose file to this command to create an ad hoc 
        preview of an alternate compose configuration. The file passed 
        via this argument does not replace the default compose file for 
        the project. Alternate compose files share the same lifecyle as 
        the previews they create: when the preview is deleted, the 
        alternate compose is deleted by the Uffizzi API. 

## FLAGS
    --set-labels=METADATA
        Metadata of deployment that contains any information which can
        be usefull for filtering deployments.

## UFFIZZI WIDE FLAGS
    These flags are available to all commands: --project. Run $ uffizzi 
    help for details.

## EXAMPLES

    To create a preview with an alternate compose file, run:

    To create a preview with single label, run:

    To create a preview with multiple labels, run:

        $ uffizzi preview create \
        --set-labels="github.repo=my_repo github.pull_request.number=23"
