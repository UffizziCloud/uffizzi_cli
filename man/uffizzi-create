uffizzi preview create [COMPOSE_FILE] [UFFIZZI_WIDE_FLAG \|\.\|\.\|\.]
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.nf
Creates a new preview\. If no COMPOSE_FILE is specified, the preview
is created with the project\'s default compose file\.

This command can fail for the following reasons:
    \- The project does not have a default compose file set\. Run
      $ uffizzi compose \-\-help for details\.
    \- The alternate compose file is invalid\.

For more information on Uffizzi previews, see:

.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"
.nf
[COMPOSE_FILE]
    An alternate compose file to the default compose\.

    You can pass a compose file to this command to create an ad hoc
    preview of an alternate compose configuration\. The file passed
    via this argument does not replace the default compose file for
    the project\. Alternate compose files share the same lifecyle as
    the previews they create: when the preview is deleted, the
    alternate compose is deleted by the Uffizzi API\.

.SH "UFFIZZI WIDE FLAGS"
.nf
These flags are available to all commands: \-\-project\. Run $ uffizzi
help for details\.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.nf
