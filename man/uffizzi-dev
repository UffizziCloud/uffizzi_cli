Manage Uffizzi development environments\.

Use these commands for building, pushing, and deploying your
project changes to a remote development cluster\. Cloud\-based
dev environments offer many benefits compared to traditional
local development, including:
  \- More similar to production deployments
  \- Access to more memory and CPU for resource\-intensive
    apps
  \- Scalability and flexibility for microservices apps
  \- Faster build times
  \- Avoid accumulation of build artifacts on local machine
  \- App components available at public URLs or IP addresses
  \- TLS certificates for HTTPS
  \- Better team collaboration via shareable links
