uffizzi-dev-stop - stop a development environment
================================================================

## SYNOPSIS
    uffizzi dev stop

## DESCRIPTION
    Stops a dev environment and deletes the backing
    Uffizzi cluster resources, including any persistent
    volumes, and the namespace itself. The Uffizzi
    cluster config is deleted from the kubeconfig file.

    This command watches for file changes in a given local
    project directory, as specified in your configuration file.
    It then serializes those changes and redeploys them onto
    a Uffizzi cluster.

    The command looks for a configuration at the specified
    path CONFIG_FILE. Skaffold configurations are currently
    supported. For help creating a skaffold.yaml file, see:
    https://skaffold.dev/docs/init/

    For more information on Uffizzi clusters, see:

## FLAGS
